Approach:
- 40 min of brainstorming approaches
- 30 min to code it and use tags for pointers if clueless
- 30 min of finding good solutions, creating test cases to test them with the good solutions + understanding them
- 30 min to code the solution

Linked List Cycle

Problem:
- Given `head`, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it; return True
- if a specific node can be reached again by continously following the `next` pointer of another node, LL has a cycle
- `pos` denotes index of the node that tail's `next` is connected to, to indicate the cycle
