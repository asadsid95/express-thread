Approach:
- 40 min of brainstorming approaches
- 30 min to code it and use tags for pointers if clueless
- 30 min of finding good solutions, creating test cases to test them with the good solutions + understanding them
- 30 min to code the solution

Reverse Linked List

Problem; given the head pointer for a singly linked-list, return its reversed linked list

Example:

- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 70
- 70 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Approach:

- each node consist of its value and value of the next node

using pointers:

- set up 2 pointers, one on the current node and one for none
- while loop over the LL (this will stop with iteration reaches the end of the LL)
    -
