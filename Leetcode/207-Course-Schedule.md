Approach:
- 40 min of brainstorming approaches
- 30 min to code it and use tags for pointers if clueless

Course Schedule

Given a total number of courses `numcourse`, labeled from 0 to `numcourse - 1`, and an array `prerequisites` where 
`prerequisite[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates `bi` must be completed before taking `ai`, return true if you can finish all courses 

Example 1:
`numcourse` = 2
`prerequisites` = [[1,0]]
Output = true
- for course 0, no prereq is needed. For course 1, course 0 must be taken before
