Approach:
- 40 min of brainstorming approaches
- 30 min to code it and use tags for pointers if clueless
- 30 min of finding good solutions, creating test cases to test them with the good solutions + understanding them
- 30 min to code the solution

Coin Change

Dynamic programming - breaking down problems into subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculation

Problem:
- given an integer array (containing coins of different denominations) and an integer (representing total amount of money), return fewest number of coins to make up that amount.
- If amount cannot be made by any combination of that coins, return -1

Example:
- coins = [1,2,5] ; target = 11
- 5+5+1 == 3
